ðŸ”®Our Project: Pixudi is an NFT-based blockchain project where a traditional race board game meets Heroes of Magic mechanics, powered by the blockchain and NFT technology. We give board game manufacturers a way to effortlessly enter the blockchain industry as well as reducing the entry barrier for traditional tabletop game fans.

ðŸ›£Our Track:  UX/UI perfection

ðŸŽ®Our Goal now: One of the features planned in our project is the ability to play for tokens and multi-chain support for several networks. In particular, within the framework of the game, the player can go under the wallet of his network and play only in rooms with players from the same network. Moreover, special NFT loots will be released for different networks and they can be bought, for example, only for tokens of the Everscale network.
To enable the user to participate in various games and receive prizes and access to events in various networks, we need a convenient and comfortable bridge.

Thus, we are preparing a comfortable and beautiful solution in terms of design, which will allow, first of all, to transfer tokens inside our project.
